# Sumo: Bulky Find & Replace

## Not a stable release, but works.

Sumo performs an in memory, bulk find / replace operation on a text file given a CSV pair list of terms.

It's capable of performing as big an operation as your RAM will accomodate. It's big & brutal, for when heavy lifting is the only option.

Note: Do not use on binary data, it may work but crazy stuff will eventually happen.

Sumo, big yet nimble.
