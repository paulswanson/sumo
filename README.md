# Sumo: Bulky Find & Replace

## Currently under development, not yet working or stable.
Sumo performs an in memory bulk find / replace operation on a text file given a CSV pair list of terms.

It's capable of performing as big an operation as your RAM will accomodate.

It's big & brutal, for when heavy lifting is the only option.
