# Sumo: big yet nimble

### High Performance Find & Replace Utility

Need to do a big find-replace operation? Sumo is for you.

Sumo performs an in memory, bulk find-replace operation on a text file given a CSV pair list of terms.

It's designed to use all the available CPU & RAM your system has to offer. Sumo will read the entire file into RAM, perform a parallelised find-replace based on your CSV of terms and then write the result to disc.

It's capable of performing as big an operation as your RAM will accomodate. So it's up to you to ensure you have enough resources for the job. It's big & brutal, for when heavy lifting is the only option. 

Note: Do not use on binary data, it may work but crazy stuff will eventually happen.

Sumo, big yet nimble.
